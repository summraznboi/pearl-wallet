## Development Setup

### Requirements

- Node.js 20.20.2
- pnpm 8.6.0

### Install dependencies

```bash
pnpm install
```

### Mobile Inner Repo Setup

The Android/iOS mobile app lives in a separate repository and must be checked out into:

```bash
apps/unisat-wallet-mobile
```

Once the mobile repo is present, use the shared bootstrap flow:

```bash
pnpm mobile:bootstrap
```

This does three things:

- installs root workspace dependencies with `pnpm`
- checks the mobile toolchain and local env files
- prepares the mobile app for monorepo builds

You can run the mobile environment check at any time with:

```bash
pnpm mobile:doctor
```

### Run apps

```bash
# Browser extension
cd apps/extension
pnpm build:chrome:mv3:dev

```

### Optional: Enforce extension `tsc --noEmit` on push

Install repository hooks once:

```bash
bash scripts/install-hooks.sh
```

This enables a local `pre-push` hook that runs:

```bash
cd apps/extension && tsc --noEmit
```

The check is triggered only when pushed commits include changes under `apps/extension/**`.

## Project Principles

- **Single source of truth** for wallet core logic
- **Shared packages first**, platform code as thin layers
- **Strict dependency boundaries** between apps and packages
- **Security-oriented design**, especially around key management and permissions
